      Europe project IQUA , supported by The Interreg V ‚ÄúVlaanderen-Nederland‚Äù program. Aims to provide qualitative solutions for decentralized wastewater treatment through innovation. There is the testing of wastewater technologies at a goat farm, a catering business, a carwash, and a local football club. There is a strong focus on the local reuse of treated wastewater and the recovery of raw materials (nutrients) and energy.

    summary: |
      't Hof Bellewaerde, an old farm, was converted into a small camping site. The property is 3.3ha and is located on an archaeological site of World War I, which is why disturbance of the soil must be limited. Since utilities are excluded for 't Hof Bellewaerde and because the owners also want to keep their ecological footprint as small as possible, the wastewater from the toilets and the communal sanitary block will be purified by a Phytoparking. This is an aerated constructed wetland that is placed under a parking lot. This purified wastewater will subsequently be reused for toilet flushing. This ecological approach ensures that the impact on the site is minimal.

    summary: |
      The fishing and aquaculture industry in China has thrived, predominantly situated in rural areas. However, this success has prompted concerns about the impact on rural wastewater treatment in Guangdong, posing a challenge to the region's economic growth. This project addresses this issue by focusing on the design and implementation of innovative facilities or technologies aimed at efficient nitrogen removal and enhanced dissolved oxygen concentration. These improvements are essential for the potential reuse of water, aligning with sustainable wastewater management practices.
